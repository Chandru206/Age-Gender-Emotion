# Deep Learning Facial Expression Recognition

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Facial Expression Recognition system using deep learning techniques. It utilizes the Haar cascade classifier for face detection and the FER-2013 dataset for training the model. The system achieves high accuracy in recognizing seven basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

## Key Features

- Utilizes Haar cascade classifier for face detection.
- Trained on the FER-2013 dataset for recognizing seven emotions.
- Implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models for improved performance.
- Proficient in data preprocessing techniques and model optimization.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- FER-2013 dataset
